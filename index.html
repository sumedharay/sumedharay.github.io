    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    
    <p>I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Economics at the <strong>University of Oklahoma</strong>, specializing in <strong>labor economics</strong>. My research focuses on <strong>political economy and socio-economic outcomes</strong>, particularly the effects of <strong>communal violence on minority groups in India</strong>.</p>

    <p>I primarily use <strong>econometric methods</strong>, such as <strong>difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis</strong>, to analyze large datasets and draw policy-relevant insights. Through my work, I aim to contribute to discussions on <strong>governance, equity, and development</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Beyond Research</h2>
    <p>Outside academia, I enjoy <strong>music, photography, and sports</strong>. Feel free to explore my work or reach out for collaborations and discussions!</p>
