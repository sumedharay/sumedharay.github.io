            <p>I am a second-year Ph.D. student specializing in labor economics and political economy. My research examines the socio-economic impacts of communal violence on minority groups in India, with particular emphasis on labor market outcomes and development economics.</p>

            <p>My research utilizes advanced econometric methods, including difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis, to analyze large-scale datasets. This empirical approach allows me to derive policy-relevant insights on governance, equity, and economic development.</p>

            <p>My ongoing work investigates how political and social upheavals affect economic outcomes, with a specific focus on minority communities in developing economies. Through this research, I aim to contribute to our understanding of the intersection between social conflict and economic development.</p>

            <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I maintain interests in music and sports, which provide valuable perspectives that enrich my research approach.</p>
