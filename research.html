        <h2>Beyond the Ashes: Tracing Women's Empowerment in the Wake of Gujarat's Communal Violence</h2>
        <p>
            This study explores the long-term effects of the 2002 Gujarat riots on the empowerment of Muslim women. 
            In the aftermath of the violence, many women were forced to assume greater financial and social responsibilities, 
            leading to shifts in traditional gender roles. The study examines key indicators such as labor force participation, 
            education levels, decision-making autonomy, and access to healthcare to assess how communal violence reshaped 
            women's socio-economic trajectories.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) methodology, the study compares Muslim women's socio-economic 
            outcomes before and after the riots, in Gujarat and in other states with similar demographic characteristics. 
            It aims to understand whether these changes were temporary survival strategies or led to lasting empowerment. 
            The findings contribute to discussions on resilience, gender dynamics, and the broader socio-political 
            consequences of communal violence.

        <h2>When Home Becomes History: Forced Migration and the Aftermath of the Gujarat Riots (2002)</h2>
        <p>
            Communal violence often triggers forced migration, leading to significant demographic shifts and long-term 
            economic consequences. This study investigates how displacement following the Gujarat riots affected employment, 
            education, and economic integration among affected communities, with a particular focus on Muslim families 
            who were forced to flee their homes.
        </p>
        <p>
            By leveraging census data and large-scale household surveys, the research examines disparities between displaced 
            and non-displaced communities in terms of employment outcomes, educational attainment, and household income. 
            Additionally, it analyzes whether government rehabilitation efforts were effective in supporting resettlement. 
            The findings provide insight into the socio-economic costs of communal violence and the long-term impact of forced migration.
